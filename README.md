Hello and thank you for reading me

This code has been worked on by 1 person over 6 years alot of passion and dedication went into learning and understanding
into how operating systems work and how to manage software also replicating a file system in a video game

None of the code is commented as I was the only one working on it but due to the projects source code being open
maybe ill start commenting it

Anyway I hope this helps someone for something or just as a learning experiance

Once again thanks for reading.

You also need to use Unity 5.6 if you want to use this code as it all uses the old UI system.
